Design documentation:

<!-- 2017.6.5 -->
This version is originally designed for crossmodal experiment v2, between-subject design. 

Experimental conditions in this version will show to all participants. In the real experiment, these conditions are commented out, e.g. participants will not have access to all conditions. 

<!-- 2019.6.8 -->

As a demo, the usage of the web audio API are recovered in this version.
